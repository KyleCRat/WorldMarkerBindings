# World Marker Bindings

World Marker Bindings is a lightweight addon that adds direct keybindings for World Markers, including variants that place markers at your cursor position. It removes the need to create and manage macro-based marker bindings while keeping the functionality fast and combat-safe.

This addon exists to provide the world marker keybinding features found in the Method Raid Tools (MRT) addon, without requiring the full MRT package to be installed.
